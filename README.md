## Ask Your Constitution

A basic application done as a POC on how a locally run LLM model like mistral can be used to extract and summarize laws from a constitution. Here, it has been done on the Constitution of India. 
This app utilizes express as a backend and runs ollama using python. All of this is represented using ReactJS as a web app.

This app can further be upgraded in a way which is very useful for lawyers as well as normal citizens, to be educated on what is legal and not. For now it is just a pre-trained LLM. 

Still on the path to create a better model that is specifically trained on the Constitution to improve speed and quality of answers given by the model...
